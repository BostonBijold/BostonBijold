In the last 4 years I have lead our development teams to produce 3 live products that are being used by over 100 employees and 10,000 clients. While leading our team I created a Machine Learning Bookkeeper named SALY. SALY is written in Python using Flask and scikit-learn. This year it has categorized over 570,000 transactions in our custom accounting software with a 96% accuracy. The accuracy is calculated by comparing its categorization against transactions changed by our bookkeepers and tax accountants. SALY has decreased our bookkeeper's workload by 50% and decreased the time between our client's data being enterd and being categorized for reporting from 1-2 months to nearly instantly upon connecting their bank accounts. 
I am currently working on using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to accuratly predict how long it will take to complete a client's tax return and which steps they should take next to speed up the process based on their current status. 
My experience with project management and machine learning programming make me an ideal cadidate to manage my time as in a self-directed enviroment while optimizing the project for the best results. I believe the hardest part of creating a Machine Learning project is not the code or the algorithm used, it is fully understanding the problem to know if Machine Learning can be used as a solution. Once the problem is defined, the solution can be quickly written and correctly fine tuned for the expected results.  

Over the past four years, I have led development teams in delivering three live products that have significantly impacted our organization, serving over 100 employees and 10,000 clients.

During this time I the development of SALY (Same As Last Year), a Machine Learning Bookkeeper built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn. SALY has revolutionized our accounting processes by categorizing over 570,000 transactions in our custom accounting software with an impressive 96% accuracy rate. This accuracy is validated through comparison with transactions manually changed by our bookkeepers and tax accountants after SALY's categorization. SALY has not only reduced our bookkeepers' workload by 50% but has also slashed the time between client data entry and categorization from 1-2 months to nearly instantaneous upon connecting their bank accounts.

Currently, I am spearheading a project leveraging Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict the completion time of client tax returns accurately.

My extensive experience in both project management and machine learning programming uniquely positions me to thrive in a self-directed environment while optimizing projects for optimal outcomes. I firmly believe that the crux of a successful Machine Learning project lies not only in the code or algorithms employed but in thoroughly understanding the problem at hand to determine if Machine Learning can indeed provide a viable solution. Once the problem is well understood and defined, a program can be quickly written and fine-tuning  to achieve the desired results.

My proven ability to lead successful projects, coupled with my expertise in machine learning programming, makes me an ideal candidate for effectively managing time and resources while delivering impactful results. I am eager to bring my skills and passion for innovation to your team and contribute to the advancement of your objectives in managing the life cycles of machine learning models.
